## Creating Dynamic Reports from your Shiny App

Here, you'll find all materials created for the talk *Creating Dynamic Reports from your Shiny App* that will be presented on March 15, 2022 at the [R-Ladies St. Louis](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-st-louis/) Meetup Group.

If you are comfortable with Git/Github, feel free to fork and clone this repository to use the files. If you would just like to download all files as a Zip folder, click on the green **Code** button to the upper-right of the file list above and click **Download ZIP**.

To follow along during the presentation, you'll need to have R/Rstudio installed on your computer along with a couple of R packages.

- [Download R](https://cran.rstudio.com/)
- [Download RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
- Install the neccesary packages by running the following line in your Rstudio console:
  - `install.packages(c("shiny", "knitr", "officer", "officedown", "tidyverse", "palmerpenguins", "flextable"))`

*You might notice that there aren't a ton of files in this repository just quite yet. That's because I'm still working on them! Please check back closer to March 15, and I'll promise those files will be here!*
